<h1>Generalized Geometric Constraint Solving and Mechanism Output Parameterization for Computational Design</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> 
    Computational design tools have traditionally existed to improve the efficiency of mid- to late-stage phases in the mechanical design process, such as dimensional drawing generation, preparation for manufacturing, and assembly bill-of-material finalization.  This CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software has become irreplaceable in the engineering and creative industries for the development of technical documentation, and has even expanded into numerical analysis for optimization of designed structures, but is nonetheless absent from early concept generation.  With developments in machine learning, the field of generative design has begun to expand into this gap, providing designers with enhanced tools for application in the earlier stages of mechanism creation.  This project seeks to explore and contribute to these new advancements, most notably through the development of a generic three-dimensional geometric constraint solver and the tools for classification of mechanism outputs and motion.
