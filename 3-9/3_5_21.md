# 3-9 Mar 5, 2021
This week, I began work on implementing the work in the [Disney Paper](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20140804211255/CDMC1.pdf).  Notably, Section 3 of that paper describes the simple [Geometric Constraint Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_constraint_solving) used to solve for the mechanism link positions.  There is significant literature of Constraint Solvers, and admittedly, I got a little bogged down in the weeds during implementation.

I had initially started writing a kinematic solver similar to the one from MENG325, but it occurred to me that manually solving vector loop equations is not scalable, and have since begun something similar to what is described in the above paper.  Admittedly, I am a little behind schedule on this, as I made the choice to change implementation style recently.  I am on track to have the general framework outlined tonight.

I am currently writing the solver in Python with `numpy` and `scipy`, mostly because I prefer the scalability of Python over Matlab.  `numpy` and `scipy` are mostly implemented in C, so frankly they're probably faster than anything I could write myself.

After completing the solver framework tonight, I'll begin working on the curve similarity model also described in that paper.  The intention is still to have this done by next week.
