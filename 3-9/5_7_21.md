# 3-9 May 7, 2021
Because last week was slow for the project, and I pushed things back slightly, I continued to work on the quaternion rotation bug, but think I am making good progress.  In the interest of not getting stuck on that, I also began the framework necessary for the machine learning side of the project.  With curve parameterization in place, the work here (according to the disney paper) is (1) implementing a supervised model and (2) iterating over randomly generated curves mechanisms and curves to rank similarity.  SciPy's neural network implementation will help with (1).  (2) will require some work to make efficient I think, but should hopefully be relatively automatic except for the easy job of evaluating curve similarity.

At this stage, I have the boilerplate for entering curve parameters as classification metrics in the neural net for (1).

I also spoke with Prof. Aspnes about an extension, and he confirmed this is possible.  The limiting factor is when the grade can be assigned.  That is, so long as Prof. Booth has time to grade the work and report before senior grade deadlines, I can submit later.
