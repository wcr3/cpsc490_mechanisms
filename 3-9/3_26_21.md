This week, I continued implementation of the [Disney Paper](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/disneyresearch/wp-content/uploads/20140804211255/CDMC1.pdf), and worked on visualization using `matplotlib` for the mechanisms.  My constraint-solver is actively changing, and so the architecture of the code is shifts around as I progress.  For the time being, it is at least passible, although it seems to struggle in cases where multiple solutions exists, or when the solution is a 'rigid' equilibrium (i.e. when several members are exactly co-linear). 

Nontheless, the visualization is functional, and I have begun implementing the curve parameterization described in Section 5 of the paper.  This involves normalizing the curve to its centroid and maximum length in its priniciple directions, then evaluating its normalized geometric properties.  In addition,
