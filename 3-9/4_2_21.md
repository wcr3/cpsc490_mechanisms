This week, I completed the general restructure of the entire geometric constraint solver and moved it into its own package.  I then began the work on implementing curve parameterization.  This involves determining the [principal components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) of all the points in the curve, normalizing by the scale and orientation of the major axis, and then evaluating various curve features.  Most of my work this week was in implementing principal component analysis.  I have yet to actually evaluate curve features, but these are relatively simple arithmetic operations (length, area, ellipticity, etc.).  

The more complex curve comparison happens with point-wise comparison, which will require curve-resampling along constant lengths to match curve resolutions.  This is the next task on my list.  Following this, the curve comparisons can be used to train the ML model.

In addition to this, there are still some improvements I'd like to make to the overall system.  The first is asynchronous solving, so that the main thread can go about setting up the machine learning model while the constraint solver creates curves for input.  This would also serve a GUI well, which I'd also like to have (although admittedly that is much lower on the list).
